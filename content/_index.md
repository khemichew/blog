Hello, and welcome to my personal blog!

I started blogging after receiving encouragement to share my
programming explorations. Since then, it's been a way to document 
stuff I find interesting and how things work the way they do. 

The articles represent my personal findings and may not be wholly accurate
(I do try to cross-check thoroughly!).

You can reach me via [email](mailto:khemichew01@gmail.com), or find my 
CV [here](/docs/resume.pdf).
